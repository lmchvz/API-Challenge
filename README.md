## Python API - WeatherPy Challenge 

### Project Description: 
The goal of this project was to use Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals skills to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Python script was created to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator using the citipy Python Library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy) and the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api). 

This python script was then used to build a series of scatter plots saved as png images to showcase the following relationships:
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

### Tools Used: 
- matplotlib 
- pandas 
- numpy 
- python requests
- json 
- Python Library: Citipy
- Open WeatherMap API
